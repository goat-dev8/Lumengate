//!
//! # Roles
//!
//! - **Admin**: Can manage all roles and update the minimum delay. By default,
//!   the contract itself is the admin, meaning admin operations must go through
//!   the timelock process.
//! - **Proposer**: Can schedule operations. Proposers are also automatically
//!   granted the Canceller role.
//! - **Executor**: Can execute operations that are ready. If no executors are
//!   configured, anyone can execute ready operations.
//! - **Canceller**: Can cancel pending operations.
//!
//! # Usage Pattern
//!
//! The timelock controller is typically set as the **owner** of target
//! contracts. This ensures that all privileged operations on those
//! contracts must go through the timelock's proposal lifecycle, providing
//! transparency and allowing time for review before execution.
//!
//! ## Operations on Target Contracts
//!
//! When the timelock controller "owns" a target contract, the proposal
//! lifecycle is:
//!
//! 1. Proposer schedules operations targeting owner-protected functions on the
//!    target contract with a delay >= minimum delay
//! 2. The delay period allows stakeholders to review the proposed changes
//! 3. After the delay passes, executor (or anyone if no executors are
//!    configured) calls `execute_op` to invoke the target contract function
//! 4. Canceller can cancel pending operations before execution
//!
//! **Example**: If a token contract has `mint()` protected by owner
//! authorization, and the timelock is the owner, then minting new tokens
//! requires scheduling through the timelock, waiting for the delay, and then
//! executing.
//!
//! ## Self-Administration Operations
//!
//! When the contract is deployed with `admin` set to `None`, the contract
//! address itself becomes the admin (self-administration). For
//! self-administration operations (e.g., updating the minimum delay, granting
//! and revoking roles), the proposal lifecycle is:
//!
//! 1. Proposer schedules the operation targeting the timelock contract itself
//! 2. After the delay passes, call the admin function directly (not via
//!    `execute_op`)
//! 3. The `CustomAccountInterface` implementation validates the operation is
//!    ready and marks it as executed by checking the executor's role and
//!    authorization
//!
//! This approach ensures administrative changes go through the timelock
//! process.
//!
//! **Note**: Self-administration requires special handling because Soroban does
//! not allow re-entrancy: a contract cannot call its own public functions
//! during execution (e.g., `execute_op` cannot internally call `update_delay`
//! on the same contract). To work around this, the `CustomAccountInterface`
//! implementation validates and marks operations as executed without performing
//! the cross-contract call, allowing admin functions to be called directly.
//!
//! ## Optional External Admin
//!
//! An optional external admin can be provided during deployment to aid with
//! initial configuration of roles after deployment without being subject to
//! delay. However, this role should be subsequently renounced in favor of
//! administration through timelocked proposals to ensure all administrative
//! actions have proper oversight and transparency.
